## 🛠️ DevOps & CI/CD Pipeline

The core of this project is the **Automation Engine**. I treat my portfolio as a production-grade application.

### 🔄 Deployment Workflow

1. **Local Dev**: Built on **Pop!_OS** (Linux) using Vite.
2. **Secret Management**: Automated environment syncing via `vercel env pull`.
3. **CI/CD**: Automatic production deployments on `git push origin main`.
4. **Asset Delivery**: Video walkthroughs are served via a **Global Edge Network (CDN)** to reduce Time-to-First-Byte (TTFB).

## 📱 Key Engineering Features

- **Case Study Integration**: Every project features a technical breakdown (Problem, Solution, DevOps Outcome).
- **Intelligent Asset Loading**: Video previews use `muted`, `loop`, and `playsInline` for high-performance browser rendering.
- **Status Placeholding**: Visible "System Initializing" states for upcoming backend microservices.
- **Mobile First**: Fully responsive layouts optimized for touch-points and high-DPI screens.
